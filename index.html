      <p> Hi, my name is <strong>Alexander Conti</strong>!</p>
      <p> I am currently in my second year of a <strong>BSc (Hons) Computer Science</strong> degree with a specialization in <strong>Software Engineering</strong>. Before university, I studied Computer Science in GCSEs and at College. I have always been passionate about the subject as a whole, which is why I decided to continue my education and expand my knowledge in this field!</p>

      <p>Software development is a dynamic field that combines creativity and technical skills to create applications that solve real-world problems. My passion for programming began in my early teens when I started learning Python for GCSEs. At the beginning, I struggled learning the basics, but my teacher helped me keep pushing. Over time, I got better, and I've developed a strong interest in many other languages.</p>
