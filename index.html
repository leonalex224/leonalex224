      <p class="dev-paragraph">Software development is a dynamic field that combines creativity and technical skills to create applications that solve real-world problems. My passion for programming began in my early teens when I started learning Python for GCSEs. At the beginning, I really struggled learning the basics, but my teacher saw something in me which helped me keep pushing. Over time, I got better and better and since then, I've developed a strong interest in many other languages.</p>
